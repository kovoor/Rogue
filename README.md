# Rogue
A F.E.A.R. inspired FPS with Advanced AI, large outdoor terrains, basic networking, pickups, skeletal meshes, checkpoints and more.
This project is my Final Year Project for the Computer Science course that I am undertaking at Lancaster University, UK.
Some of the types of complex AI frameworks that will be implemented over the coming weeks is Goal Oriented Action Planning AI Framework (GOAP)
and Adaptive AI (where the game learns to adapt to the skills of the player and adjusts the difficulty).
